</section>

  <h2>What is this Council?</h2>
  <p>The IT Services Industry Council is a strategic working group made up of founders, executives, and experienced professionals from our region’s leading tech service firms.  Our goal: to create and execute a shared vision for expanding IT services jobs, support, and investment here at home.</p>
</section>

 
<section>
  <h2>Why this Council?</h2>
  <P>The six-county Capital Region of Florida (Leon, Liberty, Gadsden, Jefferson, Franklin, and Wakulla) is poised to grow its information technology (IT) sector by leveraging Tallahassee’s assets while uplifting surrounding rural communities. Tallahassee’s tech industry already contributes <B>$1.2 billion</B> to the local economy with a projected <B>28% tech workforce growth by 2030</B>. Dozens of tech companies call Tallahassee home, ranging from software firms serving 1,800+ clients nationwide to IT integrators and managed service providers. However, neighboring counties face socioeconomic disparities – for example, Gadsden County’s poverty rate, while improving, <B>remained 23% in 2019</B>, and these areas struggle to retain working-age talent. Establishing an <B>Information Technology Services Industry Council</B> will unite experienced industry leaders to drive <b>thoughtful growth</b> – creating high-quality jobs, advocating pro-tech policies, preparing sites for business expansion, and developing a skilled workforce. </P>

  <h2>What are IT Service businesses?</h2>
  <p>Simple, do you or your company build or service: cloud, apps, robotics, data science, AI, cybersecurity, web, networks, data centers, integrations, automations, business software, servers, virtualization, tablets, dashboards, firewalls... your get it. </p>
