  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>I am Bryan Gibson, a <A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryangibson/">real person</A> and have volunteered to find local technology leaders and innovators to form a regional council for our industry by the Greater Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce. </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why you?</h2>
  <p>I did my research, and your background and previous experience are what we need.  We’re inviting a select group of 10–15 regional leaders with direct experience in IT services—founders, executives, and seasoned professionals with a proven impact.</p>
</section>
  
<section>
  <h2>What do we consider IT?</h2>
  <p>It may be easier to define what is not powered by some form of computation and code today.  But to name some terms and technologies it's: cloud, apps, robotics, data science, AI, cybersecurity, data centers, integrations, automations, business software, servers, virtualization, tablets, ... </p>
  <p>Today's world is driven by these technologies and their adoption into various industries.</p>
</section>
  
<section>
  <h2>Why this Council?</h2>
  <p>The IT Services Industry Council is an invitation-only initiative to build strategy for IT growth, jobs, and innovation in our greater Tallahassee region. Members work together on what matters—workforce, investment, site readiness, and smart policy.</p>
  <P>The six-county Capital Region of Florida (Leon, Liberty, Gadsden, Jefferson, Franklin, and Wakulla) is poised to grow its information technology (IT) sector by leveraging Tallahassee’s assets while uplifting surrounding rural communities. Tallahassee’s tech industry already contributes <B>$1.2 billion</B> to the local economy with a projected <B>28% tech workforce growth by 2030</B>. Dozens of tech companies call Tallahassee home, ranging from software firms serving 1,800+ clients nationwide to IT integrators and managed service providers. However, neighboring counties face socioeconomic disparities – for example, Gadsden County’s poverty rate, while improving, <B>remained 23% in 2019</B>, and these areas struggle to retain working-age talent. Establishing an <B>Information Technology Services Industry Council</B> will unite experienced industry leaders to drive <b>thoughtful growth</b> – creating high-quality jobs, advocating pro-tech policies, preparing sites for business expansion, and developing a skilled workforce. </P>
